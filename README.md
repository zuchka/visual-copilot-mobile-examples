# Visual Copilot Mobile Framework Examples

This repo demonstrates Visual Copilot's ability to translate a complex Figma design into all the major mobile frameworks: Swift, Jetpack Compose, Flutter, and React Native.

See the readme in each directory for framework-specific instructions.

Each demo uses the same chat interface design from this Figma file: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1325597018063319916
